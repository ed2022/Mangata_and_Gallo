                <h3>Owner Mariana Gallo</h3>
                <p> 
                    Here at Mangata and Gallo,  we are a jewelry store that specialize in special occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries. We primarily operates online and has a small storefront in Austin, Texas with an atelier attached for browsing. Our selection of jewelry is known for its high-quality and classic look. Our owner, Mariana Gallo, is an Austin local. She is well known for her jewelry designs.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo. After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened the first store in her hometown, Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help manage the company website and social media accounts. So, this website was created!
